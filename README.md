# ðŸ¤“ HelloWorld

&nbsp;

&emsp; This nerdy GitHub repository is designed to be a collection of all programming language.

&emsp; Hence differences among compiling, we intend to, as making this project work, follow these primary rules below:

 > Files named with `NotImplemented` are samples with `Hello, world!`.

1. All programs are to print the following sentence, "`Across the Great Wall, we can reach every corner in the world.`", which is exactly the content of China's first email back in 1987.

2. Always choose the **simplest** way to implement.

3. Keep same language in same folder.

4. Only source code attaches.

5. Add compiling command to `Makefile` after new language attached (optional).

&emsp; So, this is what we do. If you would like to contribute, do follow the rules above. And great thanks anyway :)
