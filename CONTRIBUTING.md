How to Contribute
=================

&emsp; This is a nerdy project to collect programming languages. If you would like
to contribute, please follow the primary rules below.

Pull Requests
-------------

1. All programs are to print the following sentence, "`Across the Great Wall
we can reach every corner in the world.`", which is exactly the content of
China's first email back in 1987.

2. Always choose the **simplest** way to implement.

3. Keep same language in same folder.

4. Only source code attaches.

5. Add compiling command to `MakeFile` after new language attached (optional).

Issues
------

1. Notice us if there's a typo or any problem else.
2. Much appreciate if you would rather attach new ones than asking for it.
3. Issues in languages other than English and Chinese will be Google
   translated into English later.
